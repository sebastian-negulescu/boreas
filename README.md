# boreas

## Compiling and Running

### Compiling
To build for development, run `bear -- make debug` in your command line.

Otherwise, run `make boreas` in your command line.

### Running
Run the program from the project directory with `./boreas`.

## Assumptions and Limitations
Currently, I will assume no power falloff for light rays coming from emissive materials.
